            For starters web development is pretty cool, so down below are gonna be a collection of websites that are really cool: <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://p3re.jp">Peronsa 3 Reloaded website</a><br>
            This website is <i>sooooooooo</i> cool, sure its laggy as hell on my potato laptop but anywhere else it is AMAZING.<br>
            Alot of it probably comes into the design of it and that it is definitely throughly thought out unlike mine lmao.<br>
            Even then I think this is one of the websites that I would like to actually understand majority of the source code behind it.<br>

            <a href="https://fallenhuman.neocities.org">Az's Special Hell</a>
