        <h1>cool websites: </h1>
        <p>
            For starters web development is pretty cool, so down below are gonna be a collection of websites that are really cool: <br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://p3re.jp" target="_blank">Peronsa 3 Reloaded website</a><br>
            This website is <i>sooooooooo</i> cool, sure its laggy as hell on my potato laptop but anywhere else it is AMAZING.<br>
            I think this is one of the websites that I would like to actually understand majority of the source code behind it.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="https://fallenhuman.neocities.org" target="_blank">Az's Special Hell</a><br>
            One of the first pages I saw on here and I was like yooooooooooooo having a personal website seems cool!<br>
            Interesting thoughts in their journals and nice chara content :&#41;<br>
            <br>
            Again, still a work in progress so check out the cool gif below.
