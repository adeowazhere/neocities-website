        <h2>Undertale/Deltarune</h2>
        <p>
            If you couldn't tell by the font, I <i>love</i> these lil games.
            Undertale probably my favourite game but Deltarune is one that I have been hypnotised by for some reason.
            Very excited for what would happen in the following chapters and I am definitely keeping updated!

        <h2>PS Vita:</h2>
        <p>
            The PS Vita is subjectively the best handheld as you can easily fit it into your pocket and its pretty light!
            And after a <i>little</i> tinkering around you can customize it a bit more to get something that feels a lil more personal too!
        </p>

            Here is an <i>outdated</i> pic of mine, since I'm changing the theme for it:

        <h2>Yu-Gi-Oh</h2>
        <p>
            Started out playing a Utopia deck, then got bored because there was only two lines for it.
            Pretty glad that I didn't stay on that deck for long because I found one of my favourite decks ever:
            <i><b>Live Twin Spright!</b></i>
            Very fun graveyard mechanic and Sprights just help make it more playable 10/10
        </p>

        <h2>Cubing:</h2>
        <p>
            Not the fastest or anything but I do enjoy it when my hands are bored. 
            My current PB (personal best) is 28.98 seconds but I average about 35 seconds.
            When I first started, I really thought it would be crazy hard but its not! So you should give it a try later :&#41;

            There are other interests but they are not <i>too</i> note-worthy, but feel free to ask me about them some time :D
