        <h2>Undertale/Deltarune</h2>
        <p>
            If you couldn't tell by the font, I <i>love</i> these lil games.<br>
            Undertale probably my favourite game but Deltarune is one that I have been hypnotised by for some reason.<br>
            Very excited for what would happen in the following chapters and I am definitely keeping updated!<br>

            This is kinda outdated, currently working on a Gundam themed PS Vita now lol
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems to be subjectively the best handheld as you can easily fit it into your pocket and its pretty light!<br>
            And after a <i>little</i> tinkering around you can customize it a bit more to get something that feels a lil more personal too!<br>
            Sucks that I only play games on it when I'm out and about tho...<br>
